Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> CMD DIRECTION
Rule 2     expression -> NO CMD DIRECTION

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CMD                  : 1 2
DIRECTION            : 1 2
NO                   : 2
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . CMD DIRECTION
    (2) expression -> . NO CMD DIRECTION

    CMD             shift and go to state 1
    NO              shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (1) expression -> CMD . DIRECTION

    DIRECTION       shift and go to state 4


state 2

    (0) S' -> expression .



state 3

    (2) expression -> NO . CMD DIRECTION

    CMD             shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (1) expression -> CMD DIRECTION .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> CMD DIRECTION .)


state 5

    (2) expression -> NO CMD . DIRECTION

    DIRECTION       shift and go to state 6


state 6
