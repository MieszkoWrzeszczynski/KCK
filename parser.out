Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> GO DIRECTION
Rule 2     expression -> NO GO DIRECTION
Rule 3     expression -> GO NUMBER DIRECTION

Terminals, with rules where they appear

DIRECTION            : 1 2 3
GO                   : 1 2 3
NO                   : 2
NUMBER               : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 0
